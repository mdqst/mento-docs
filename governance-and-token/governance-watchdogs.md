# Governance Watchdogs

To ensure a sound governance process and detect any potentially malicious proposals, the Mento Protocol has set up a Governance Watchdogs group to monitor and review all proposals.

Further details on who's in this group and how it works can be found on this [Governance Watchdogs Notion Page](https://mentolabs.notion.site/Mento-Governance-Watchdogs-1c523e14987740c99fa7dedd490c0aa9).
