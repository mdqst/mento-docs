# What, why, who Mento?

### What?

Mento is a decentralized and transparent protocol that enables the creation of stable value digital assets, such as assets that track the value of fiat currencies (commonly referred to as ‘stablecoins’). The goal of Mento is to support the real-world adoption of digital currencies by enabling the creation of stable value assets for users around the world.

### Why?

Stable value digital assets are a crucial building block in the web3 economy as they enable a stable store and transfer of value and provide for fast, secure, and low-cost transactions.&#x20;

More developed web3 markets also call for a more diverse stable value asset landscape to serve the growing demand for remittances, mobile payments, saving, lending, and borrowing in local currencies.

The Mento Protocol aims to provide a solution: A multi-currency stable asset ecosystem to enable real-world usability.
