# Deployment Parameters

Mento v2.0.0 contracts are configured via [Celo Governance Proposals](https://celo.stake.id/#/). The parametrization and deployment details can be found in the [Mento-Deployment](https://github.com/mento-protocol/mento-deployment) repository and in corresponding governance proposals.

Details about deployment parameterization and parameter explanations can be found in this [config contract](https://github.com/mento-protocol/mento-deployment/blob/main/script/upgrades/MU01/governance/Config.sol).&#x20;

Since governance can change these parameters, what is deployed with this configuration is not necessarily up-to-date. Current parameterization can be accessed in the Celo block explorers with the [deployment addresses](deployment-addresses/).&#x20;
