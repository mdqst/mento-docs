# Mint/burn with Mento

Mento protocol allows users to deposit CELO and mint new stable assets into existence. Users can also burn stable assets they have on hands to receive back the deposited CELO from the reserve.

{% hint style="info" %}
it is not recommended for users to trade with Mento directly. Because of the specifics of the stability mechanism, transactions performed with Mento smart contracts might be subject to high slippage.
{% endhint %}

**All transactions with the Mento protocol are subject to 0.25% fee.**

If you are looking to exchange a relatively high amount and can't do that because of high slippage, we recommend using [celo trading bot](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-exchange-bot) (requires technical knowledge to be able to implement and run the bot). The bot allows you to break down the big transaction into a chain of smaller ones that will be executed over a prolonged period of time automatically.
