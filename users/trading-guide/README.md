# Trading guide

There are three ways how the one can buy or sell mento stable assets:

1. Through one of the [centralized](broken-reference) or [decentralized](broken-reference) exchanges.
2. [Through one of the on-ramp partners.](broken-reference)
3. [Through mento protocol directly.](broken-reference)

In [this article](broken-reference) you will find information on how to use limit orders and the maximum slippage parameter.

## Which way is best for you?

It really depends on a couple of factors:

**Your geographical location**. Some centralized exchanges can be accessed from certain regions, and some governments allow their citizens to access only some exchanges. Depending on where you are, you will have to find an exchange that operates in your jurisdiction.

**Which asset do you start with**? For example, if you have US dollars in your bank account you might prefer an exchange that has a direct pair cUSD/USD.

**The total amount you want to trade**. All exchanges have different trading volumes at different times. The rule of thumb - the higher the daily trading volume is, the better.
