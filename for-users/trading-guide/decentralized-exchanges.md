# Decentralized exchanges

### Purchase from one of the decentralised exchanges

Decentralized exchanges (DEX for short) are permissionless protocols and available to practically anyone around the globe, without any restrictions applied. (Your local government still might impose some regulations prohibiting their citizens from accessing DEXes, so do your own research).&#x20;

You will have to know how to use a non-custodial wallet (e.g Metamask, Ledger, Valora, TrustWallet, etc.) and have some cryptocurrency in your wallet to begin with. Majority of DEXes have smart routing built-in, so it doesn't really matter which asset do you start with - as long as the mento token is listed there, it will find a way to perform a trade.

Keep in mind that transactions with the exchanges are subject to fees.
