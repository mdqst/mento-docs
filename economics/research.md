### Stability Analysis

A stability analysis was conducted that investigates the stability characteristics of Mento stable value assets through a series of simulations under various market conditions. In this analysis, simulation techniques are used to understand the behavior of the protocol and its potential vulnerabilities over a wide range of possible developments â€” including severe shocks, attacks, extremely positive and extremely negative market movements. A wide range of possibilities was modeled, rather than relying on historical data, because the space is too new to rely on historical prices for modeling purposes.

A good introduction into the stability analysis - especially for users not used to reading economic research papers - can be found in this blog post (Mento stable assets were previously called Celo stable assets):&#x20;
