# Reserve

### Introduction

The Mento reserve is a diversified portfolio of crypto-assets which support the ability of the Mento protocol to expand and contract the supply of Mento stable assets in-line with user demand.

### Reserve

A live status of the reserve can be found at the[ Mento Reserve website](https://reserve.mento.org/), where we go deeper into asset allocation, custody, and value of the reserve.

Celo native assets are held in the governable reserve smart contract, while non-Celo assets are held in custody at various custodians, controlled by a MultiSig consisting of several members of the Celo and Mento community.

### Decentralization

[Mento Labs](https://www.mentolabs.xyz/)[Mento Labs](https://www.mentolabs.xyz/) is working towards full decentralization by bringing the Mento Protocol cross-chain. The Mento Labs cross-chain initiative is working on allowing decentralized asset custody and management by holding and managing Ethereum assets in a Ethereum smart contract.
