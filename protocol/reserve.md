# Reserve

### Introduction

The Mento reserve is a diversified portfolio of crypto-assets supporting the ability of the Mento protocol to expand and contract the supply of Mento stable assets, in-line with user demand.

### Reserve

A detailed breakdown and current status of the reserve can be found at the [Mento Reserve](https://reserve.mento.org/)[ website](https://reserve.mento.org/), where we go deeper into assets allocation, custody, and value of the reserve.&#x20;

Celo native assets are held in the governable reserve smart contract, while non-Celo assets are held in custody at various custodians, controlled by a MultiSig consisting of several members of the Celo and Mento community.

### Decentralization

[Mento Labs](https://www.mentolabs.xyz/) is working towards full decentralization by making the Mento Protocol cross-chain. The Mento Labs cross-chain initiative is making Mento multi-chain and thereby allowing decentralized asset custody and management by holding and managing Ethereum assets in a Ethereum smart contract.&#x20;
