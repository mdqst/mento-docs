# On-ramp Providers

If you don't want to use centralized exchanges and on-ramp crypto assets directly into your decentralized non-custodial wallet, you can use several on-ramp providers to do so.&#x20;

With on-ramp providers, you can buy Mento stable assets directly with a credit card or from a bank account. You will need to create an account and provide identity identification before you can use their services.&#x20;

[Ramp network](https://ramp.network/) has the best coverage around the globe and the best fees (free).

If it doesn't work for you for some reason, you can try using [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/) or [Simplex](https://www.simplex.com/) instead.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Valora](https://valoraapp.com/) is a mobile crypto wallet native to the Celo blockchain. They aggregate all available cash in/out options in their app. Check [this support article](https://support.valoraapp.com/hc/en-us/categories/360006359592-Adding-and-Withdrawing-Funds) on their website for more info.&#x20;

Cashing out to a credit card/bank account is not supported by any of the existing providers at the moment.
