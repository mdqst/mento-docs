# On Celo

Mento's origins are on the [Celo blockchain](https://celo.org/), where the creation and redemption of stable assets is possible as well as several decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are available for trading.&#x20;

For interacting with a blockchain, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. A popular choice among users is [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/).

## Decentralized Exchanges

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are the primary way of exchanging assets in the decentralized finance community. There are multiple DEXs on Celo where you can exchange Mento stable assets:&#x20;

* [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
* [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/celo/swap)
* [Sushi](https://www.sushi.com/swap?fromChainId=42220)
* [Ubeswap](https://app.ubeswap.org/#/swap)

## High-liquidity Curve Pool for cUSD

The Mento reserve maintains a [high-liquidity Curve pool](https://curve.fi/#/celo/pools/factory-v2-35/deposit) with 20 million USD in liquidity, split between cUSD and USDCet. USDCet is USDC bridged from Ethereum via [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) and the [Portal Token Bridge](https://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer). &#x20;

## Mento

The [Mento web app](https://app.mento.org/) is a direct gateway to the Mento protocol. The web app is maintained by the Mento Core team and allows the exchange of stable with collateral assets. Depending on the direction of the trade, stable assets are either created or burned directly by the reserve.&#x20;

Please be aware, that for large orders against non-USDC collateral assets, slippage might increase since the mechanism protects itself against oracle manipulation risk. For larger amounts, USDC pairs or the high-liquidity Curve pool are good places to trade.
