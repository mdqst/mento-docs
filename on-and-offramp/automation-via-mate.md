## Automation via MATE
MATE (Mento/Mighty Asset Management Engine) is a toolkit specifically designed for seamless Mento stables ramping.
MATE defines and manages asset flows and steps. These flows are made up of sequential steps, which represent distinct operations that either move or transform digital assets. Moving a digital asset can encompass actions like transferring between bank accounts, withdrawing from exchanges, or bridging assets. Swapping a digital asset might involve executing a trade on either a centralized or decentralized exchange. Each flow is essentially a series of these steps, tailored and configured to ensure seamless asset management.
