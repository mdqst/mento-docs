# Overview

Mento's origins are on the [Celo blockchain](https://celo.org/), where the creation and redemption of stable assets is possible as well as several centralized & decentralized exchanges (CEXs & DEXs) are available for trading. You can also get stable assets via on-ramp providers in exchange for fiat currencies.

For interacting with a blockchain, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. A popular choice among users is [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [MiniPay](https://www.opera.com/de/products/minipay) or [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/).
