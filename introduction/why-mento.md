# Why Mento?

Stable assets are a natural solution for existing inefficiencies in the financial ecosystem as they are a stable store and transfer of value and enable fast, secure and low-cost transactions.&#x20;

So far, there has been only a limited real world adoption with USD only stablecoins, and there are ongoing concerns about the transparency, degree of decentralization, or quality of the collateral of existing stablecoins, like USDT or UST.&#x20;

Existing use cases have been trading focused, and regulation tightens on fiat-backed stables. More mature crypto markets call for FX solutions, and there is a growing demand for remittances, mobile payments, saving, lending, and borrowing in local currencies.&#x20;

Mento aims to provide a solution: A multi-currency stable asset ecosystem to enable real world usability.&#x20;

Mento enables an ecosystem of crypto-collateralized stable assets that are local to the geographies that they serve - a unique, permissionless and usable stable asset for every country in the world.
